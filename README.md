## Mathematical Basis of the Least Squares Method

The least squares method is a mathematical technique used to find the best-fitting line (or curve in more general cases) to a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals.

**1. The Goal:**

Given a set of data points of both X and Y, we aim to find a linear equation
that best describes the relationship between the X and Y variables.

**2. Minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors:**

The core principle of the least squares method is to find the values of the slope and the y-intercept that minimize the sum of the squares of these errors (SSE):

By calculating these values from the input data, the least squares method provides the linear equation that minimizes the overall squared difference between the observed data and the fitted line. This line is considered the "best fit" in the sense that it minimizes this specific measure of error.


## How to use the Calculator
First, Give a set number of value points to the calculator to indicate how many points you want to give.

Secondly, Give the data points corresponding to its X and Y values, 
          --(Note that the order of the X and Y values matters)
          --(Note that the amount of X and Y value points, must be equal to the desired points in the first question)
    **Example**:
        X = [1 2 3 4 5];
        Y = [3 5 6 2 6];
            Therefore the points are:
                [(1,3) (2,5) (3,6) (4,2) (5,6)]

And once all the values have been properly inputed
The calculator will then show the least squared formula 
with least linear measure of error as possible
and showing a graph with
